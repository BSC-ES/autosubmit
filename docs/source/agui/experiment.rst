   Experiment View

At the top left you see the **Back To Search** button that will take you back to the Search page. Next to that is the experiment name and description followed by the experiment's status, which is queried every 5 minutes.

On the left side we have some metadata including the path to the experiment files. Below that we have the branch of the model that was used in the experiment, and the HPC name.

On the center you see the :ref:`treeRepresentation`.
