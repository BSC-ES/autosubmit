   Experiment Information

At the top left you see the ``Back To Search`` button that will take you back to the :ref:`autosubmitGUIMP`. Next to that is the experiment name and description followed by the experiment's status, which is updated every 5 minutes.

On the left side we have some metadata including the path to the experiment files. Below that we have the ``branch`` of the ``model`` that was used in the experiment, and the ``HPC name``.

On the center you see the :ref:`treeRepresentation`, which is loaded automatically when you open this page.
