HOW TO USE
==========

cd src

- First Step:

python expid.py -h

python expid.py --new ecearth --HPC ithaca --description "experiment is about..."

Say for example, "chex" is 4 character based expid generated by system.
First character "c" will represent the platform such as "i" for ithaca, "b" for
BSC, "h" for HECToR and so on and rest of three characters "hex" will show a 
unique hexadecimal number.

- Second Step:

vi /cfu/autosubmit/i00f/conf/expdef_chex.conf
vi /cfu/autosubmit/i00f/conf/autosubmit_chex.conf

- Third Step:

python create_exp.py chex

- Fourth Step:

nohup python autosubmit.py chex >& chex_01.log &


HOW TO MONITOR
==============

Autosubmit will be generating the plots to visualize the status of experiment 
periodically at the following location:

/cfu/autosubmit/chex/plot

On the other hand, user can generate plots at any instance by following the 
instructions given below:

cd src

python monitor.py -h

python monitor.py -e chex -j job_list -o pdf
or
python monitor.py -e chex -j job_list -o png
